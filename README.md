The 3D-scanned model of the CX4 motor is found in this project (this projects is a complete cover without need to buy the Kettler-covers like my project): <br />

Sorry for the code-mess in this project. I have until now used OpenSCad for all my 3d-printer models.
OpenSCad might not be the best tool for this job - but I managed.... by using uncountable numbers of magic-numbers, endless hours of trial and error - and lots spaghetti-hardcoding.
I am not proud at all for the code - but I must say a big thanks to Raphael Luckom for his article about bezier-curves in OpenSCad! (link on top). He speeded up my rendering very much!
I can see the bezier-curves can simplify much of this project, but I did not spend time to convert and clean up after I found Raphaels article.<br />
His article will be much used from now on! Thanks! 

This project does the job and I managed to make a cover! Please free to clean up my code :-)

The 3mf-files is saved by PrusaSlicer and printed on my Prusa MK4S with MMU3. I used 0.6 nozzle to manage overhangs better.
